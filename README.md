# MobisecScan

A tool based on MobSF, focused on enhancing the following capabilities:
1. Restructuring the rules as per OWASP 2024
2. Adding additional functions to the static analyser that may require more steps than just pattern matching
3. Using NLTK to derive context to categorise permissions and intents into malicious/non malicious with lower false positive rate
